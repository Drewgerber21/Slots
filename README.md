# Musical Scales Command Line Slots

This purpose of this project is to create a working slot machine that
can be played from the command line using c++. The win condition for
these slots would be when the three randoom notes that are selected make
a chord. This could be any three note chord, the more complex the chord,
the higher the value. For example: major, minor, diminished, and 
augmented chords are worth different amounts of points, different
inversions could be worth different amounts of points, and the different
root notes will be worth different amounts of points.
